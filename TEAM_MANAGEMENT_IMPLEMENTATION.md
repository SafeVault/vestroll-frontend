## Usage

### Empty State
When there are no employees in the system, the page displays:
- Empty state illustration
- "No employees yet" heading
- Descriptive message
- "Add Employee" button

### Populated State
When employees exist:
- Desktop: Full table with all columns and pagination
- Mobile: Card-based layout with all information
- Search and filter functionality
- "Add Employee" button in header

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Desktop View**: Verify table displays correctly with all columns
2. **Mobile View**: Test card layout on various mobile screen sizes
3. **Empty State**: Test with no employees (modify mock data count to 0)
4. **Pagination**: Verify pagination works with table and card views
5. **Actions**: Test edit and delete button interactions
6. **Responsive**: Test breakpoint transitions between desktop and mobile

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Implement actual Add Employee modal/form
2. Connect Edit button to employee edit functionality
3. Add delete confirmation modal
4. Implement real API integration
5. Add sorting functionality to table columns
6. Add bulk actions (select multiple employees)
7. Export functionality for employee data

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ Avatar images display correctly  
✅ Action buttons (edit, delete) implemented  
✅ Desktop and Mobile-optimized card layout  
✅ "Add employee" button in header  
✅ Responsive for desktop and mobile views  

## Notes
